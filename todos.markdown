# TODO

## Short-term

* show subject of each expense on "expenses" page
* fix "delete" links on expenses page
* make expenses list and total sum refresh after deleting an expense on expenses page

* create timestamp for Expense (maybe as an after_save hook)
* add the ability of fitering expenses between two dates on expenses page

* get rid of the Pot model
* make a form builder for the commonly used form (ul-li-label-input)

## Long-term

# DONE

* populate should use nice user names and logins/passwords
* redirect to /expenses after logging in
